# Welcome to Commonmarks

## What is Commonmarks?

Commonmarks is a self-hosted bookmarking web application written with Ruby on Rails. The idea behind Commonmarks isn't to compete with other bookmarking aplications, but to provide a self-hosted alternative that let's you save and organise your bookmarks.

## What's coming up?

I'm working on this on my own time, so features will be delivered as and when I can fit the time in to work on them.

Here's a little lightweight roadmap of what I am hoping to add in the next few months:

- An owner can reset their password
- Tags can be sorted by frequency or name
- Tag bundles can be shared or hidden

Looking a little further ahead, here's what I have in plan for the long term:

- The ability to host multiple accounts on a single instance.
- A bookmark page showing an individual bookmark and related bookmarks.
- The ability to automatically add bookmarks via RSS feeds.
